In essence, Decision Trees is flowlike chart structure where each node of the tree is used to test a particular attribute of the object. For example, imagine I have a person which will represent our object. We then test certain attributes of this person object. For example, one test would be whether they are male or female. The test will represent a \"Decision Node\" in our tree, and each of the possible outcomes \"Male\" or \"Female\" will represent a leaf node.The first \"Decision Node\" in our Decision Tree will be our \"Root Node\"\n"

This condition is generally interpreted as a sign that the stock is overvalued, and the price is likely to go down. A stock is said to be oversold when the price goes down sharply to a level below its true value. This is a result caused due to panic selling. RSI ranges from 0 to 100, and generally, when RSI is above 70, it may indicate that the stock is overbought and when RSI is below 30, it may indicate the stock is oversold.\n",

Well, lucky for us, we already have the change_in_price column, so we can use a condition that will set the value to 0 if the price went up for down days and vice versa for up days. After that, I need to make sure I have the absolute values for down days, or else the calculation won't be correct, so I modify that column and then calculate the EMA of both the Up and Down columns.

        "The Price Rate of Change is another easy indicator to calculate in pandas because we can leverage a built-in function. In this case, we will use the pct_change function and apply it to our all too familiar symbol groups. For the pct_change function, we have an argument called periods which specifies how far we need to look back when calculating the rate of change. In this case, the paper never provided a specific n, but after doing some research, I landed on an n of 9 because this seemed to be the standard window. Now, it's important to note that the paper changes n depending on the window, so technically I'm not doing exactly like they did. For example, if my prediction window was 30 days then n should be 30."

The function simply calculates the diff for the closing price and uses a for loop to loop through each row in the volume column. If the change in price was greater than 0 we add the volume, if it's less than 0 we subtract the volume and if it's 0 then we leave it alone.\n",

However, we are missing one critical piece of information that is crucial to the model, the column we wish to predict. Now at this point, our data frame doesn't have that column, but we will create it before we feed the data into the model.\n",

        "However, before we create it, I want to take some time and understand the exact problem we are trying to solve. Our goal is to predict whether the next day is either a down_day or an up_day. Based on this knowledge, we are solving a classification problem. If you don't remember, there are two categories of problems in machine learning, classification, and regression. With classification problems, we try to predict which group new values belong to. For example, based on store sales, are they outperforming store or an underperforming store. Classification problems are problems that have discrete groups. With regression problems, we are trying to predict non-discrete values and, for example, trying to forecast future sales based on previous sales.\n",

        "To create our prediction column, we will group our data frame by each symbol. After we've created our groups, we need to select the close column as this contains the price we need to determine if the stock closed up or down for any given day. Now, we can use a similar logic we used to calculate the price change. However, in this case, we only need to know if the price is higher or lower compared to the previous day.\n",
        "\n",
        "Take your groups, use the transform method to apply a lambda function to your groups. The lambda function will use the diff() function to compare the current price to the previouse price. We then wrap the results of that function in the numpy.sign() function. That function will return 1.0 for negative values (down days), 1.0 for postive values, and 0.0 for no change (flat days)."

In some cases, some of our features might not be very important, or in other words, when compared to additional features, don't explain much of the model.\n",

        "What that means is if we were to get rid of those features, our accuracy will go down a little, hopefully, but not significantly. You might be asking, \"Why would I want to get rid of a feature if it lowers my accuracy?\" Well, it depends, in some cases, you don't care if your model is 95% accurate or 92% accurate. To you, a 92% accurate model is just as good as a 95% accurate model.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, if you wanted to get a 95% accurate model, you would, in this hypothetical case, have to train your model twice as long. Now, I'm a little extreme in this case, but the idea is the same. The cost doesn't justify the benefit. In the real world, we have to make these decisions all the time, and in some cases, it just doesn't warrant the extra cost for such a minimal increase in the accuracy.\n",

        "If you want, you can also graph the feature importance of our model, so it's a little easier to visualize the results. What I do in the chart below is chart the cumulative importance or, in other words, how much does each feature add to the total. That way, we can see how much each feature is contributing to the overall importance. Another standard graph that is used is a bar chart."

A curve is drawn by plotting True Positive Rate (sensitivity) against False Positive Rate (1 - specificity) at various threshold values. ROC curve shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. When the curve comes closer to the left-hand border and the top border of the ROC space, it indicates that the test is accurate. The closer the curve is to the top and left-hand border, the more accurate the test is. If the curve is close to the 45 degrees diagonal of the ROC space, it means that the test is not accurate. ROC curves can be used to select the optimal model and discard the suboptimal ones."
